# Another-Skillcheck-Architecture-Test
This is skillcheck for some company, focus is on OOP being prepared to switch for better technologies just by writing the clients/services.


**So far done:**
- Elastic & Mysql magic classes (These always return something to not deal with not found cases in this test)
- Switch of datasource usage through env variable 
- Simple file cache service with interface - ready to be changed for Redis
- Count service that counts searches into file 
- controller returning json + Application test for it 
- MAX stan lvl

**To be done:**
- unit tests
- coverage
- document how to run tests locally
- github actions?
- more fancy stuff?
